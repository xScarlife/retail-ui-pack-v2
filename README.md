Please follow these instructions step by step in order to install my ElvUI profile correctly.

1) Download the latest ElvUI version from this link: https://www.tukui.org/download.php?ui=elvui.
2) Drag the ElvUI folders you can find inside the .zip file to your AddOns folder. In most cases the AddOns folder is located at C:\World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\AddOns.
3) Launch the game and make sure all ElvUI addons are checked to be loaded.

5) Once my ElvUI import string is imported, go to 'Profiles' and make sure the correct profile called 'xScarlife' is selected. This can be found under the 'Existing Profiles'.
6) Now open your chat window and paste in this code: **/run SetCVar('nameplateShowOnlyNames', 1); ReloadUI()**
7) Reload your interface to save all these changes by opening your chat window and writing /reload
8) My ElvUI profile should now be successfully installed.

**NOTE:** I also use friendly nameplates with this ElvUI profile. In order to turn them on use the key combination "Shift+V" on your keyboard to turn the friendly nameplates on if they are not enabled by default!
