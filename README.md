This version 2 package contains performance fixes and new interface features. Please make sure you follow the steps below before you continue making any changes. If you have any problems during installation or you have additional questions, please do not hesitate to ask for help in the Discord server, me and my moderators are happy to help where we can.

If you don't know how to install addons manually, please watch my video where I teach you how to do that by clicking this link: https://youtu.be/huUvI7O-6lE?t=83

## **ElvUI Profile Installation - Dragonflight**

1) Download the latest ElvUI version from this link: https://www.tukui.org/download.php?ui=elvui

**NOTE 1:** I also use friendly nameplates with this ElvUI profile. In order to turn them on use the key combination "Shift+V" on your keyboard to turn the friendly nameplates on if they are not enabled by default!

**NOTE 2:** If you are in a dungeon or raid, friendly nameplates will also be active there. By default the friendly nameplates castbar will be shown and can be distracting when raiding. To turn them off please paste in this code in your chat window: 

**/run SetCVar('nameplateShowOnlyNames', 1); ReloadUI()**

Due to the upload size restrictions I left out some AddOns that took to much space in the file itself. If you want you can download them manually from the links below.

1) TradeSkillMaster: https://www.tradeskillmaster.com/install
2) Raider.IO: https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/raiderio
3) Better Wardrobe: https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/better-wardrobe-and-transmog
4) Weakauras: https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/weakauras-2

Thanks for reading, have fun!
