This version 2 package contains performance fixes and new interface features. Please make sure you follow the steps below before you continue making any changes. If you have any problems during installation or you have additional questions, please do not hesitate to ask for help in the Discord server, me and my moderators are happy to help where we can.

If you don't know how to install addons manually, please watch my video where I teach you how to do that by clicking this link: https://youtu.be/huUvI7O-6lE?t=83

**AddOn Package Installation:**

Download and open the .rar file from this Github page and this will contain all the addons I use. You can simply drag and drop the folder over to your WoW Retail addons folder mostly located on your main C: drive like so, C:\World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\AddOns. 

**Extra:** If you can't open .rar files, you can download WinRAR here: https://www.win-rar.com/download.html?&L=0

Once you dragged and dropped the desired addon folders from the .rar file to your AddOns folder you can simply close all windows and launch your game. When on the character selection screen, please go to the lower left corner and select 'AddOns'. Make sure that all the addons you want to load in-game are checked or this can cause problems if you are missing one. If you receive any LUA error's in-game, logout and open the Curseforge addon manager. Let it scan your addon folder and update all the addons.

**ElvUI Profile Installation:**

The main interface is ElvUI but this is **not** included in the addon package. Why? ElvUI makes the file size of this addon pack to large in order for me to upload it. You can copy my ElvUI import string by downloading the "xScarlife ElvUI Profile Retail V2.txt" file from this Github page. Once downloaded, open the .txt file and copy the code. Go in-game and import my profile.

**NOTE 1:** I also use friendly nameplates with this ElvUI profile. In order to turn them on use the key combination "Shift+V" on your keyboard to turn the friendly nameplates on if they are not enabled by default!

**NOTE 2:** If you are in a dungeon or raid, friendly nameplates will also be active there. By default the friendly nameplates castbar will be shown and can be distracting when raiding. To turn them off please paste in this code in your chat window: 

**/run SetCVar('nameplateShowOnlyNames', 1); ReloadUI()**

Due to the upload size restrictions I left out some AddOns that took to much space in the file itself. If you want you can download them manually from the links below.
